About the Marine Community Profile (MCP)
----------------------------------------

This document provides information on the Marine Community :term:`Profile` (hereafter MCP) of :term:`ISO19115`.

The MCP was first devised by members of the Technical Committee of the `Australian Oceanographic Data Centre Joint Facility (AODCJF) <http://www.aodc.gov.au/index.php?id=24>`_ in 2006. 

Versions 1.0 to 1.2 of the MCP were based on an :term:`XML` implementation of :term:`ISO19115` devised by Scott Bainbridge at the `Australian Institute of Marine Science <http://www.aims.org.au>`_. Versions 1.3 (and higher - from 2007 onwards) are based on the XML implementation of :term:`ISO19115` set out in the :term:`ISO19139` standard. 

One of the first implementations of the MCP using the :term:`GeoNetwork` Opensource software was done as part of the `Australian marine science data network (BlueNet) project <http://www.bluenet.org.au>`_ which was funded by the Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) of the Australian Government. Since then, the MCP usually implemented in GeoNetwork, is used by other members of the AODCJF, including:

- `Australian Bureau of Meteorology <http://www.bom.gov.au>`_
- `Australian Antarctic Division <http://www.antarctica.gov.au>`_
- `Australian Institute of Marine Science <http://www.aims.gov.au>`_
- `CSIRO - Commonweath Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation <http://www.csiro.au>`_
- `Royal Australian Navy Meteorology and Oceanography <http://www.metoc.gov.au>`_

The MCP is also used by:

- `Integrated Marine Observing Network (IMOS) <http:///www.imos.org.au>`_
- `Australian Oceanographic Data Network (AODN) <http:///www.aodn.org.au>`_
