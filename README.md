Documentation about Marine Community Profile (MCP)

Documentation is written using restructured text. You need to install sphinx
to build it from http://sphinx-doc.org/

UML diagrams were drawn using Umlet which is an open source UML diagram drawing tool - http://www.umlet.com/ - it is written in java and runs on Linux, Windows etc

Makefile
make.bat - makefiles to build documentation

eg. make html

The directories in this repo are as follows:

source - restructured text documentation

uml -    Umlet UML diagrams for MCP extensions 

themes - restructured text accessories (leave these alone!)
